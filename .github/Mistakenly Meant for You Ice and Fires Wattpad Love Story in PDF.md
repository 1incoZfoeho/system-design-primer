A cell phone novel is a literary work that is written on a mobile phone and delivered to readers in short chapters via text messaging or online platforms. This genre emerged in Japan in 2003, when a man named Yoshi wrote Deep Love, a story about a teenage girl who sells her body and contracts AIDS. The novel became a viral sensation and was adapted into various media forms. Cell phone novels soon gained popularity among young Japanese women who wrote about their personal experiences, feelings, and struggles with topics such as love, sex, violence, and identity. The novels were often written in a poetic and fragmented style, using white space, line breaks, and colloquial language to create an intimate and emotional effect. The chapters were usually less than 200 words long, but some novels accumulated millions of views and readership online. Many of them were also published as books and became bestsellers in Japan. Since then, cell phone novels have spread to other countries such as China, South Korea, Germany, Italy, South Africa, and the United States, where they have inspired a new generation of writers and readers who use this form to express themselves creatively and authentically.

Some famous examples of cell phone novels are: Koizora (Love Sky), Akai Ito (Red String of Fate), Kimi No Sei (It's Your Fault), Moshimo Kimi Ga (If You) and more. These novels have been adapted into movies, TV shows, manga, and anime, reaching a wide audience and influencing popular culture. Some of them have also been translated into other languages and published in other countries. For instance, Koizora was translated into Chinese and Korean and sold over two million copies in China.
